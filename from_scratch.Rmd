## intro

calculate elo ratings from scratch every time, starting from all ratings 1500

have to sort out new teams?

to start, set them to 1500 also

## packages

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
source("from_scratch.R")
games <- read_rds("~/Documents/r-projects/scoresway/rds/games.rds")
```

## play

```{r}
league <- "scotland"
ids <- c(58114, 53513, 47730, 47731)
```


```{r}
cg <- get_clean_games(ids, games) 
cg
```

I need the games without results for this, but this is later


```{r}
cg$d %>% pivot_longer(t1:t2, names_to="t_name", values_to="team") %>% 
  group_by(team) %>% count(comp) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = comp, values_from = n)
```
